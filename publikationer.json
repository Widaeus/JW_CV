		"abstract": "Both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viremia and nasopharyngeal viral load have been suggested to be predictors of unfavorable outcome in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate whether nasopharyngeal viral load is correlated with viremia and unfavorable outcome.The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined in paired nasopharyngeal and serum samples collected at admission from patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Standardized cycle threshold values (CT values) were used as an indicator of viral load. An adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of viremia at different nasopharyngeal CT values. A Cox regression was used to estimate the risk of 60-day mortality.A total of 688 patients were included. Viremia at admission was detected in 63% (146/230), 46% (105/226), and 31% (73/232) of patients with low, intermediate, and high nasopharyngeal CT values. The adjusted odds ratios of being viremic were 4.4 (95% CI, 2.9–6.8) and 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4–3.0) for patients with low and intermediate CT values, compared with high CT values. The 60-day mortality rate was 37% (84/230), 15% (36/226), and 10% (23/232) for patients with low, intermediate, and high nasopharyngeal CT values at admission, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios were 2.6 (95% CI, 1.6–4.2) and 1.4 (95% CI, 0.8–2.4) for patients with low and intermediate CT values compared with high CT values.There was a dose-dependent correlation between nasopharyngeal CT values and viremia at admission for COVID-19. Moreover, there was an increased risk of 60-day mortality for patients with low, compared with high, nasopharyngeal CT values.",

		"abstract": "Studies on the antiviral effects of remdesivir have shown conflicting results. SARS-CoV-2 viraemia could identify patients in whom antiviral treatment may be particularly beneficial.To investigate antiviral effects and clinical outcomes of remdesivir treatment in viraemic patients.Viraemic patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of ≤300, symptom duration ≤10 days, and estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min were included in a cohort. The rate of serum viral clearance and serum viral load decline, 60 day mortality and in-hospital outcomes were estimated. A subgroup analysis including patients with symptom duration ≤7 days was performed.A total of 318 viraemic patients were included. Thirty-three percent (105/318) received remdesivir. The rate of serum viral clearance [subhazard risk ratio (SHR) 1.4 (95% CI 0.9–2.0), P = 0.11] and serum viral load decline (P = 0.11) were not significantly different between remdesivir-treated patients and controls. However, the rate of serum viral clearance was non-significantly higher [SHR 1.6 (95% CI 1.0–2.7), P = 0.051] and the viral load decline was faster (P = 0.03) in remdesivir-treated patients with symptom duration ≤7 days at admission. The 60 day mortality [HR 1.0 (95% CI 0.6–1.8), P = 0.97] and adverse in-hospital outcomes [OR 1.4 (95% CI 0.8–2.4), P = 0.31] were not significantly different between remdesivir-treated patients and controls.Remdesivir treatment did not significantly change the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viraemia, decline of serum viral load, 60 day mortality or in-hospital adverse outcomes in patients with ≤10 days of symptoms at admission. Remdesivir appeared to reduce the duration of viraemia in a subgroup of patients with ≤7 days of symptoms at admission.",

		"abstract": "Rationale: The effects of high-dose inhaled nitric oxide on hypoxemia in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) acute respiratory failure are unknown.\n\nObjectives: The primary outcome was the change in arterial oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) at 48 hours. The secondary outcomes included: time to reach a PaO2/FiO2.300mmHg for at least 24 hours, the proportion of participants with a PaO2/FiO2.300mmHg at 28 days, and survival at 28 and at 90 days.\n\nMethods: Mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in a phase II, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled parallel-arm trial. Participants in the intervention arm received inhaled nitric oxide at 80 ppm for 48 hours, compared with the control group receiving usual care (without placebo).\n\nMeasurements and Main Results: A total of 193 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The mean change in PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 48 hours was 28.3mmHg in the intervention group and 21.4mmHg in the control group (mean difference, 39.1mmHg; 95% credible interval [CrI], 18.1 to 60.3). The mean time to reach a PaO2/FiO2.300mmHg in the interventional group was 8.7 days, compared with 8.4 days for the control group (mean difference, 0.44; 95% CrI, 23.63 to 4.53). At 28 days, the proportion of participants attaining a PaO2/FiO2.300mmHg was 27.7% in the inhaled nitric oxide group and 17.2% in the control subjects (risk ratio, 2.03; 95% CrI, 1.11 to 3.86). Duration of ventilation and mortality at 28 and 90 days did not differ. No serious adverse events were reported.\n\nConclusions: The use of high-dose inhaled nitric oxide resulted in an improvement of PaO2/FiO2 at 48 hours compared with usual care in adults with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19.",
