The risk of AID was also evaluated with respect to the antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) profiles.\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study comprises consecutive patients identified with APS through review of electronic medical records at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden between 2014 and 2020. Exclusion criteria were misdiagnosis and age <18. Descriptive statistics was used for baseline data and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to investigate the risk factors to develop new onset AID. Ethical approval was obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (2020-02333).\nResults: Of 271 included patients, 66% were women and the median age at diagnosis of APS was 43 years (IQR 31–55). At inclusion, 130 (48%) patients presented with other AID; 101 (37%) of them had a concomitant SARD while 54 (19%) had a NRAID. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was the most frequent in 30% of patients, followed by autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) in 10% of patients.In addition, 35 (13%) APS-patients developed AID during the study period, corresponding to an incidence rate of 28.4 (95% CI; 19.3-40.3) per 1.000 person-years with mean time at risk of 4 (±2) years. Twenty-one (8%) patients developed a SARD and further 14 (5%) were diagnosed with a NRAID.The cumulative incidence for AID was significantly higher in patients with high titers of IgG aPL. Patients that developed SARD had significantly higher median titers of a-β2GPI IgG isotype, p=0.05. In the NRAID group, median a-β2GPI and aCL IgG isotypes were significantly increased, p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively. The hazard ratio to develop diagnosis of AID was significantly increased in patients with high titers of the IgG isotype aPL (HR 2.4 95% CI; 1.1-5.3). Obstetric APS manifestations were associated with a significantly increased hazard ratio of 2.8 (95% CI; 1.1-7.7) to develop SARD, and also trendwise for AID, as a compound variable.During the study period, 52 patients had at least one new APS manifestation, as defined by the Sydney criteria (1). In comparison to patients without new manifestations, these patients had significantly higher median titers of aPL of the IgG isotype, and concomitant AID at first visit (p=0.01, p=0.02, respectively).\nConclusion: APS patients are at high risk to develop other AID, and APS patients with concomitant AID had an increased risk to develop new clinical APS manifestations. These findings might be helpful when considering risk stratification and alternate treatment options in this patient group.\nReferences: [1]Miyakis S, Lockshin MD, Atsumi T et al.

		"abstract": "Background In patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), recurrent thrombosis (re-thrombosis) is common despite anticoagulation and the mortality rate is high. Concomitant systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD) are frequent in patients with APS and often associated with disease associated damage. Less is known about the prevalence of non-rheumatic autoimmune diseases (NRAID) in these patients.\nPurpose To estimate the incidence of re-thrombosis and death, evaluate the impact of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) profiles on re-thrombosis and identify causes of death in a novel APS cohort. To evaluate the incidence and prevalence of concomitant autoimmune diseases (AID) in this cohort.\nMethods This retrospective cohort study comprises all patients identified with APS in the electronic medical records at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden 2014–2020. Descriptive statistics was presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of risk factors.\nResults 271 patients were included in the cohort. Age of APS-diagnosis was 43 years (IQR 31–55) and 66% were women. At inclusion, 130 (48%) patients presented with AID; 101 (37%) had a concomitant SARD while 54 (19%) had a NRAID. Systemic lupus erythematosus was the most frequent in 30%, followed by autoimmune thyroid disease in 10% of patients. During follow-up, 37 re-thrombosis occurred; 23 arterial and 14 venous events, with an incidence of 3.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 2.4–4.7). Significant CV risk factors for re-thrombosis were current smoking; hazard ratio 2.50, p=0.03 and chronic kidney disease; 3.44, p <0.01. Twenty-seven (73%) patients with re-thrombosis were triple positive for aPL compared to 113 (48%) without any event at follow-up (p <0.01). The cumulative death incidence was 4% (n=12) with sepsis due to bacterial infection being the most common cause. The median age at death was 63 years (IQR 51–71) and occurred 8 years (IQR 2–10) after diagnosis.In addition, 35 (13%) APS-patients developed AID during the study period, corresponding to an incidence rate of 28.4 (95% CI; 19.3–40.3) per 1.000 person-years with mean time at risk of 4 (SD±2) years.\nConclusion APS patients are at high risk to develop other AID during the 5 years follow-up period. Multiple CV risk factors are present in APS-patients suffering re-thrombosis, with smoking and chronic kidney disease being most important. APS-patients are susceptible to sepsis following bacterial infection with high mortality. These findings might be helpful when considering risk stratification and alternate treatment options in this patient group.",

		"abstract": "Background Recurrent thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a major clinical concern and treatment challenge. Data regarding risk factors and markers of recurrent thrombosis in APS patients, particularly during long-term follow-up, is limited.\nObjectives We aimed to study the effect of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) profiles on recurrent thrombosis in APS. We continued to explore if the occurrence of thrombocytopenia and decline in kidney function over time could be considered risk factors.\nMethods This retrospective cohort study comprises all patients identified with APS in the electronic medical records at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden 2014-2020. The patients were followed until death, last medical visit, and thrombotic event. Cox proportional-hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) between groups. A time-varying model was applied when the effect of the occurrence of thrombocytopenia and decline in renal function and time to recurrent thrombosis were assessed. Ethical approval was obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority.\nResults 263 patients were included in the cohort and 52.1% of patients had primary APS. The median age at inclusion was 45 years (35–60) and 66% were women. During follow-up, 47 re-thrombotic events occurred; 29 arterial and 18 venous events, with an incidence of 4.1 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 3 – 5.3). A significant CV risk factor for re-thrombosis was current smoking; hazard ratio 3.62 (95% CI: 1.4 – 9.2). Twenty-two patients (64.7%) with re-thrombosis were triple positive for aPL compared to 99 (43.2 %) without any event at follow-up (p <0.01). There was no difference in the number of patients with re-thrombosis between the primary and secondary APS. The time-varying Cox regression analyses revealed chronic kidney disease (eGFR<60) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100x109) hazard ratios 2.41, (95% CI: 1.2 – 5.0) and 7.60 (95% CI: 1.9 – 30.1), respectively, as the major risk factors for re-thrombosis in this cohort of APS patients. The cumulative mortality incidence was 4.5% (n=12). The most common cause of death was sepsis due to bacterial infection at a median age of 63 (IQR 51-71).\nConclusion Our results demonstrate that the decline of kidney function and the occurrence of thrombocytopenia in APS patients over time are major risk factors for recurrent thrombosis. Adequate surveillance and treatment options are necessary to improve kidney function and thrombocytopenia and thereby prevent further morbidity in APS patients.\nREFERENCES: NIL.\nAcknowledgements: NIL.\nDisclosure of Interests Natali Karandyszowska: None declared, Hevgin Alagündüz: None declared, Jacob Widaeus: None declared, Felicia Carlens: None declared, Anna Warnqvist: None declared, Maria Magnussion: None declared, Iva Gunnarsson: None declared, Elisabet Svenungsson Shareholder of: AstraZeneca and Pfizer, Speakers bureau: Janssen, Grant/research support from: Grant support from Merck, Maria Bruzelius: None declared, Aleksandra Antovic: None declared.",
